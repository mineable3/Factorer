# Just fooling around

This program can factor any number using a brute force technique BUT it can do it a different way

It can solve for one maybe two factors for a number ONLY IF the number is the product of two prime numbers. This is based off of a youtube video by veritasium and this technique can run much faster when you get to bigger numbers and theoretically even faster on a quantum computer.
